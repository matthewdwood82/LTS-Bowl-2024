<p>Three teams are removed from the survival pool each week until there is only one team remaining after Week 16 MNF.</p>
<p>If two teams are tied at the end of a week, the team with the fewest cumulative points to date will be eliminated.</p>
<p>These results should be considered interim until after Sleeper’s data provider has processed most of its stat corrections on Tuesdays. See <a href="https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/2441282-stat-corrections">Sleeper documentation</a> for more information.</p>
